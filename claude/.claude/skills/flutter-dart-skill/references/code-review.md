# Code Reviews

## Purpose

Code reviews are essential for maintaining a high-quality, maintainable codebase while fostering a collaborative and efficient development process.

## Reviewer Responsibilities

- Focus on correctness, clarity, and maintainability
- Check for adherence to architectural patterns (layered architecture, BLoC)
- Verify test coverage for new and modified code
- Look for potential performance issues
- Ensure consistent coding style

## Author Responsibilities

- Keep pull requests small and focused
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Self-review before requesting reviews
- Respond to feedback constructively

## What to Look For

### Architecture

- Proper layer separation (presentation, business logic, data)
- Dependencies flowing in the correct direction
- BLoC/Cubit not depending on other BLoCs
- Repositories not depending on BLoCs

### Code Quality

- Functions and methods doing one thing
- Clear, descriptive naming
- No hardcoded values (use constants or configuration)
- Proper error handling

### Testing

- New code has corresponding tests
- Tests are descriptive and follow natural sentence patterns
- Private mocks used per test file
- No shared state between tests

### Security

- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Proper input validation
- Secure data storage (Keychain/Keystore for sensitive data)

## Tools and Automation

Use automated tools to enforce standards:

- `very_good_analysis` for lint rules
- Static analysis tools for consistency
- CI/CD checks for test coverage

AI tools can assist in code reviews, but should not replace human reviewers. AI output is non-deterministic and should be paired with lint rules and testing. Code generated by AI should be carefully reviewed.

## Post-Review: Merging

- Ensure all feedback has been addressed before merging
- Consider squashing commits to keep git history clean
